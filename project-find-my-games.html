                <p>This is an iOS app designed to help basketball players to find pick up games. The user research point out that many basketball players have encountered these situations: either they have difficulty finding other players to start a game, or they arrive at the basketball court only to find that it is already full.</p>
                <p>The solution is to build a connected experience when people can find games and games can find people. The centre piece of the puzzle is to start with a location based interface and allow people to set up “clubs”. These “clubs” works like interest groups so organizers could easily add games to their clubs in the future. The game page and the user profile page act as two important hubs which are connected to each other so that a user is able to find a game through a friend or get to make friends through a game. The user can even see the thumbnails of friends profile photo before they open up the game page to get a quick glance of who is playing</p>

                <p>Most of users do not use apps to find basketball games. When asked why not, many people complained the lack of local data and social connection. When no one else is using the app to organize games, it is easy to imagine why they just use the text message on their phone to organize games. This could be convenient until the group gets bigger. Indeed, keeping everyone informed become very difficult for large groups. Not to mention often times players have difficulty to find people who want to play basketball with them. Even worse, when they finally get a group together during weekends, the basketball court could be too busy. The pick up game experience could be so much better if only there is an easy way to organize games, keep everyone informed, and be able to see if there are games in the courts they are planning to play.</p>
