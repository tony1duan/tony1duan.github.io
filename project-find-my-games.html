The typical problem of the current pick up games experience is that either the players have difficulty to find other players to start a game, or they arrive at a packed basketball court. The solution is to build a social experience where people can find games and vice versa.</p>

When asked why not, many people complained the lack of local data and social connection. When no one else is using the app to organize games, it is easy to imagine why they just use the text message on their phone to organize games. This could be convenient until the group gets bigger. Indeed, keeping everyone informed become very difficult for large groups. Not to mention often times players have difficulty to find people who want to play basketball with them. Even worse, when they finally get a group together during weekends, the basketball court could be too busy. The pick up game experience could be so much better if only there is an easy way to organize games, keep everyone informed, and be able to see if there are games in the courts they are planning to play.</p>

They are all busy with either school or work so having to cordinate with a group of friends to play basketball becomes very difficult.</p>

            <p class="standard-text gray-bbb three-fourths margin-l-r"> The center piece of the puzzle is to start with a location based interface and allow people to set up “clubs”. These “clubs” works like interest groups so organizers could easily add games to their clubs in the future. The game page and the user profile page act as two important hubs which are connected to each other so that a user is able to find a game through a friend or get to make friends through a game. The user can even see the thumbnails of friends profile photo before they open up the game page to get a quick glance of who is playing.</p>
